Answer Key
The four primary goals guiding AI development are Reasoning (drawing conclusions and making decisions), Perception (interpreting sensory data), Learning (improving performance from experience), and Interaction (communicating with humans using language or actions). These goals provide a framework for the diverse applications and subfields of AI.
Traditional Machine Learning models struggle with complex, hierarchical patterns and high-dimensional data, often requiring explicit programming. Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning, uses multi-layered neural networks (deep neural networks) to automatically learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data, overcoming these limitations.
Backpropagation is a crucial step in deep learning training where the error from the loss function is propagated backward through the network. Its primary function is to efficiently calculate the gradients, which indicate how much each internal parameter (weight) contributed to the overall prediction error.
Two architectures are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to process and analyze grid-like data such as images and videos, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), built to handle sequential data like text, speech, or time series by maintaining memory of previous inputs.
A pivotal moment was the 2012 ImageNet competition, where the AlexNet deep learning system demonstrated a dramatic improvement in visual object recognition accuracy. This propelled deep learning into mainstream attention, showcasing its powerful capabilities compared to previous methods.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two competing neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator creates new data, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish this generated data from real data. This game-like competition forces the Generator to produce increasingly realistic output.
Transfer Learning enables deep learning models to leverage "experience" gained from training on one domain or task and apply it to a new, related task. This significantly reduces the data requirements for the target problem and accelerates learning, as the model doesn't need to learn features from scratch.
Two major limitations of deep learning models are their heavy reliance on powerful hardware (like GPUs and TPUs) and large amounts of training data, and the difficulty in interpreting or explaining their decision-making processes. They can also produce unintuitive errors or behave unpredictably outside of training data environments.
AI Agents are goal-directed, autonomous systems designed to reason, plan, and act in service of their goals. They integrate components such as a planning module, API access to tools, an action module, feedback/observation mechanisms, and goal management, often driven by underlying LLMs.
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, in 1943, proposed an early model where neurons were "on" or "off" and could compute logical connectives and any computable function. They also suggested that suitably defined networks based on this model could learn, laying foundational theoretical groundwork for neural networks.
Part 3: Essay Format Questions
Discuss the historical evolution of Artificial Intelligence, tracing its path from early conceptual foundations and initial enthusiasm, through periods of "AI winter" and waning interest, to the resurgence marked by the "Deep Learning Era" and the modern development of Generative AI and Agential AI. What key technological and data-related factors contributed to each major shift?

Explain why deep learning became necessary to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, particularly when dealing with complex and high-dimensional data.
Explain the core mechanics of how a deep neural network learns, detailing the iterative optimization process involving the forward pass, loss function, backpropagation, and weight updates. Furthermore, discuss how different types of learning (e.g., self-supervised, transfer learning) expand deep learning's capabilities beyond its primary association with supervised learning.
Analyze the significance of different neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) in advancing specific AI applications. Choose at least two architectures and explain their unique design principles and how these principles make them particularly well-suited for certain types of data or tasks, leading to state-of-the-art results.
Despite its transformative impact and state-of-the-art results, deep learning faces several limitations and challenges. Discuss at least three prominent limitations, such as resource dependence, interpretability, or error types. For each, explain the nature of the challenge and briefly consider potential implications for the responsible and effective deployment of deep learning systems in real-world applications.
